## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About This Project

This is **not** a polished or production-grade app ‚Äî it's a personal tool I built for myself during times when I wanted to stay informed, but not overwhelmed by alerts.

It uses a direct connection to Telegram via my account and bot, which requires setup steps like creating a bot, getting API credentials, and running the script on a machine tied to your Telegram number.

I'm sharing it in case others find it useful or want to replicate something similar ‚Äî especially if you're technically inclined and comfortable setting things up manually.  
No guarantees, no support, just something that worked for me.

# Tsofar Alert Filter

A lightweight, real-time Telegram filter that listens to the **‚ÄúTzeva Adom‚Äù** alert channel and forwards messages to you **only if they contain specific locations** you care about.

This avoids constant notifications for irrelevant alerts ‚Äî and ensures you're notified immediately when it matters.


## üîç What It Does

- Monitors messages from the official alert channel (`@tzevaadomm`)
- Filters alerts based on keywords for:
  - Emergency areas (e.g., your home)
  - Critical or nearby regions
  - Custom areas of interest
  - Heads-up alerts
- Sends a Telegram message to your group or personal chat via a bot when a match is found

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)
- [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)

Install with:
```pip install telethon python-telegram-bot```

You‚Äôll also need to:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**  
   Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), create a new bot, and get the **bot token**.

2. **Create a Telegram Group**  
   Add your bot to the group and make it an **admin** so it can send messages.

3. **Get Chat IDs**  
   - Use the script‚Äôs debug mode (or a temporary handler) to print `event.chat.id`
   - Identify your:
     - Group chat ID (`GROUPCHAT_ID`)
     - Debug/testing chat ID (`DEBUG_CHAT_ID`)

4. **Get Telegram API credentials**  
   - Visit [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/)
   - Create a new application and save the `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, and your Telegram phone number.

## üöÄ How to Use

Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsofar-filter.git```

```cd tsofar-filter```


Replace the placeholder values at the top of tsofar-filter.py:

- API_ID, API_HASH, BOT_TOKEN, PHONE
- Target CHANNEL, GROUPCHAT_ID, DEBUG_CHAT_ID
- Location keywords (emergency_word, critical_words, etc.)

Run the script in the background:

```nohup python tsofar-filter.py &```
- Output will be saved to ```nohup.out``` by default.
- To monitor logs, use: ```tail -f output.log```

## üí° Notes
- The code is optimized for low-latency, real-time message handling.
- Some repetition is intentional to reduce overhead.
- You can use DEBUG_CHAT_ID to echo test messages and verify setup.

## üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool is provided as-is for personal use.
- It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Tsofar, Tzeva Adom, the Home Front Command, or any official alerting entity.
- It simply listens to the public Telegram channel and filters messages based on user-defined keywords.
- Always verify alerts with official sources and do not rely solely on this script in life-critical situations.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è to reduce notification fatigue during tense times.
